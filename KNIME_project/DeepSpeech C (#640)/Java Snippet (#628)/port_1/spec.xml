upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it what thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll ill think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of a house which was very likely true down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles i fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learned several things of
